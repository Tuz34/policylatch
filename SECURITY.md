# Security policy

## Scope

`mcp-guard` v0 is a static, local policy evaluator. It reads YAML and JSON files and
writes reports. It does not execute proposed actions, invoke MCP tools, connect to MCP
servers, or provide a sandbox.

The following are security-relevant:

- A malformed input or policy bypassing validation.
- A documented deny rule incorrectly returning allow.
- Unexpected file or network access by the CLI.
- Report output that exposes data not present in the supplied input or policy.

Rule coverage gaps and false negatives are important, but they are not proof of a
sandbox escape because v0 is not a sandbox.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature when it is available for
the repository. Do not include real credentials, private workspace data, or active
exploit targets. A minimal synthetic reproduction is preferred.

Include:

- Affected version.
- Command and synthetic input needed to reproduce the behavior.
- Expected and actual decision.
- Potential impact.

Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability that could expose users before a fix
is available.

## Safe test data

Tests and examples must remain synthetic. Never commit API keys, credentials, private
keys, tokens, customer data, or reports created from a real sensitive workspace.
